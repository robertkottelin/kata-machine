// Find the intersection of two sets.
// Data structure: HashSet

/*

This code snippet implements a method to find the intersection of two sets using the HashSet data structure in Java. 
The method intersection takes two HashSet objects, set1 and set2, as input, 
and returns a new HashSet containing the elements that are present in both input sets. 
The method iterates through each element in set1 and checks if it is present in set2 using the contains method. 
If the element is present in both sets, it is added to the resultSet. 
Finally, the resultSet is returned, containing the intersection of the two input sets.
